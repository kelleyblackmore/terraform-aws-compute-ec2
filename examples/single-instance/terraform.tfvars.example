# Example terraform.tfvars for single-instance
# Copy this to terraform.tfvars and customize for your needs

# AWS Configuration
aws_region    = "us-east-1"
instance_type = "t3.micro"

# Optional: SSH key pair name (must exist in your AWS account)
# key_name = "my-key-pair"

# Security Configuration - REQUIRED for access
# Get your IP: curl -s https://checkip.amazonaws.com

# Enable SSH access (disabled by default for security)
enable_ssh_access       = true
allowed_ssh_cidr_blocks = ["1.2.3.4/32"]  # Replace with YOUR IP/32

# Enable HTTP access (disabled by default)
enable_http_access       = true
allowed_http_cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # Public web server

# Alternative: Restrict HTTP to your IP only (for testing)
# allowed_http_cidr_blocks = ["1.2.3.4/32"]

# Monitoring
enable_monitoring = false  # Set to true for production

# Example Scenarios:
# 
# 1. Public Web Server (no SSH):
#    enable_http_access       = true
#    allowed_http_cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
#
# 2. Development Server (SSH + HTTP from your IP):
#    enable_ssh_access        = true
#    allowed_ssh_cidr_blocks  = ["YOUR_IP/32"]
#    enable_http_access       = true
#    allowed_http_cidr_blocks = ["YOUR_IP/32"]
#    key_name                 = "your-key"
#
# 3. Internal Server (no public access):
#    # Leave both disabled - use SSM Session Manager for access
